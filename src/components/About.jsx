        <p className="text-lg text-[#4b5563] leading-relaxed">
            Hey, I’m Brayden — a Georgia Tech CS student who turns ideas into real, usable tech. From AI to full-stack apps, I build tools that actually solve problems and get the job done.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-[#4b5563] leading-relaxed">
            Beyond coding, I’m all about growth — mentally and physically. I don’t just want to improve in tech, I want to level up every part of my life.
        </p>
